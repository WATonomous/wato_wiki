# Eve Quest Book - Spring 2025 (S25)

## The Great Objective: Level 5 Robo-taxi Around Campus

WATonomous aims to achieve a fully autonomous Level 5 robo-taxi capable of navigating the University of Waterloo campus by the end of Spring 2025. This involves integrating hardware, software, and cognition systems to enable decision-making directly within the car. Achieving this milestone establishes the groundwork for advanced autonomous vehicle research and real-world applications.
