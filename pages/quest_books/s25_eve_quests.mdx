# Eve Quest Book - Spring 2025 (S25)

## The Great Objective: Level 5 Robo-taxi Around Campus

WATonomous aims to achieve a fully autonomous Level 5 robo-taxi capable of navigating the University of Waterloo campus by the end of Winter 2025. This involves integrating hardware, software, and cognition systems to enable decision-making directly within the car. Achieving this milestone establishes the groundwork for advanced autonomous vehicle research and real-world applications.

## Term Objectives Summary

The objectives for Winter 2025 focus on integrating hardware, developing software modules, and preparing the platform for autonomous operation. These include:

1. **Hardware Integration**
   - OSCC boards: Fully integrated and functional with control drivers.
   - Sensor drivers: Implemented for all sensors (camera, GPS/IMU, Lidar, radar) and tested with rosbag recordings.
   - Mounts: Fabrication and installation of Lidar mirror mounts and radar mounts.

2. **Software Modules**
   - Perception Stack: Sensor integration and testing on the car.
   - Local Plan and Controller: Turning and obstacle avoidance capabilities tested on the car.
   - HD Map and Global Plan: Load and test an HD map of the Waterloo regional test track.
   - Behavior Tree: Implementation without requiring car testing.
   - Localization: Functional with GPS/IMU and car odometry, tested on the car.
