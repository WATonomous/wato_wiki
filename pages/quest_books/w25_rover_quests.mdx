# Rover Quest Book - Winter 2025 (W25)

## The Great Objective: Autonomous Navigation for the UWRT Rover

The WATO Rover Team is helping build the autonomous navigation system for the UWRT's [URC 2025](https://urc.marssociety.org/home/requirements-guidelines) rover. 

## Term Objectives Summary

The objectives for Winter 2025 focus on integrating UWRT's existing modules with the WATO Monorepo/watod infrastructure, as well as building out the autonomy software using nav2.

1. **Point Cloud Generator**:
    - Create a point cloud using the IntelRealSense D435 cameras and the RealSense SDK, and publish the point cloud message to Nav2 for Costmap Generation, and localization.
2. **Object Detection**:
    - Using camera feeds to generate field relative poses for mission-critical objects.
3. **ArUco Marker Detection**:
    - Using camera feeds to generate field relative poses for ArUco markers.
4. **Behaviour Tree**:
    - Using the Behaviour Tree to plan the navigation of the rover.
5. **Nav2 Integration**:
    - Use sensor data from rover to plan and control the rover.
    - Use the rover's odometry to plan and control the rover (costmap, localize, plan, and control).
6. **Simulation**:
    - Generate rover URDF and TF tree.
    - Gazebo simulation for both the rover and desert environment.
