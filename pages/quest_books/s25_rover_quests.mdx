# Rover Quest Book - Spring 2025 (S25)

## The Great Objective: Simulate navigation for a rover.

The WATO Rover Team is helping build the autonomous navigation subsystem for the [UW Robotics Team](https://github.com/uwrobotics)'s [URC 2026](https://urc.marssociety.org/home/requirements-guidelines) rover. We hope to pass the [System Acceptance Review](https://urc.marssociety.org/home/requirements-guidelines/system-acceptance-review) and do well in next year's competition.

## Term Objectives Summary

The objectives for Spring 2025 focus on building upon [Winter 2025](https://wiki.watonomous.ca/quest_books/archive/w25_rover_quests/) progress and completing essential autonomous navigation functionality for the URC. 

1. **Simulate collecting depth camera data from three different cameras.**
- Build upon the camera simulation created last term that publishes simulated point cloud data, which will allow all members to test algorithms that involve the cameras, regardless of hardware access.
2. **Costmap**
- Convert depth camera data into a costmap.
3. **Rover localization**
- Complete localization using GPS/IMU and odometry and test on simulated data and on the rover.
4. **Compute and publish goal pose of detected object.**
- Object detection of mission-critical objects for the competition (e.g. rubber mallets, water bottles) was achieved last term and tested with webcam. We need to integrate with our RealSense cameras and transform detected objects to map/odom frame so we can publish a navigation goal.
5. **Navigate autonomously to chosen waypoint.**
- Complete the planning and control modules so the rover can autonomously navigate to any waypoint. This is required for navigating to the position of a detected object, as well as navigating to a provided GPS waypoint (another required task for the competition).
6. **Write three blogs on simulating the rover**
- We are a relatively new team and hope to improve our outreach and provide documentation for future members by writing blog posts throughout the term showcasing our progress.
