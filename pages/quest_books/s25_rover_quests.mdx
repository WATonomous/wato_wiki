# Rover Quest Book - Spring 2025 (S25)

## The Great Objective: Simulate navigation for a rover.

The WATO Rover Team is helping build the autonomous navigation system for the UWRT's [URC 2025](https://urc.marssociety.org/home/requirements-guidelines) rover. 

## Term Objectives Summary

The objectives for Winter 2025 focus on integrating UWRT's existing modules with the WATO Monorepo/watod infrastructure, as well as simulating the autonomy software using nav2.

1. **Simulate collecting depth camera data from three different cameras.**
2. **Convert depth camera data into a costmap.**
3. **Navigate autonomously to chosen point.**
4. **Write three blogs on simulating the rover**

### Term Objectives and Scoring

1. **Simulate depth camera data**

| Score | Criteria                                                                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10/10 | All three depth cameras are generating and publishing data to Nav2. |
| 8/10  | All three depth cameras are generating, but not publishing data to Nav2  | 
| 5/10  | One or two depth cameras are generating and publishing data to Nav2 |
| 3/10  | One or two depth cameras are generating but not publishing data to Nav2 |
| 0/10  | No depth cameras are generating data to Nav2 |                                                      |

**Minimum Requirements:**  One or two depth cameras are generating but not publishing data to Nav2 for a score of 3/10.

2. **Generate costmap from Depth camera data**

| Score | Criteria                                                                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10/10 | Depth cameras are able to simulate an accurate costmap. |
| 5/10  | Depth cameras are able to simulate an innacurate costmap. |
| 0/10  | Depth cameras are unable to simulate a costmap and/or depth cameras are not completed |

**Upstream Dependency: Depth Camera Data**

**Minimum Requirements:** Depth cameras are able to simulate an innacurate costmap for a score of 5/10.

3. **Autonomous navigate to chosen point**

| Score | Criteria                                                                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10/10 | Rover is able to accurately and efficiently navigate to a point. |
| 7/10  | Rover is able to inefficiently navigate to a point. |
| 4/10  | Rover is unreliably able to navigate to a point. (Less than 50% success rate out of 20 tests) |
| 0/10  | Rover is unable to navigate to a point |

**Minimum Requirements:** Rover is able to inefficiently navigate to a point for a score above 7/10.

4. **Blogs**

| Score | Criteria                                                                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 20/20 | More than three blogs have been written on simulating software for the rover. |
| 15/20 | Three blogs have been written on simulating software for the rover. |
| 10/20 | Two blogs have been written on simulating software for the rover. |
| 5/20  | One blog has been written on simulating software for the rover. |
| 0/20  | No blogs have been written on simulating software for the rover. |

**Minimum Requirements:**: Three blogs have been written on simulating software for the rover for a score above 15/20.
