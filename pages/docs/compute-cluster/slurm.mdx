# SLURM

SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management)[^slurm] is an open-source job scheduler that handles the allocation of resources in a compute cluster.
It is commonly used in HPC (High Performance Computing) environments. WATcloud uses SLURM to manage most of its compute resources.

[^slurm]: https://slurm.schedmd.com/

This page provides an introduction to SLURM and any WATcloud-specific details[^watcloud-specific] to get you started quickly.
For more advanced usage beyond the basics, please refer to the [official SLURM documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).

[^watcloud-specific]: Some WATcloud-specific details include the available resources (e.g. how GPUs are requested using `shard` and `gpu` GRES),
    the temporary disk setup (requested using the `tmpdisk` GRES, mounted at `/tmp`), and software availability (e.g. docker rootless and Compute Canada CVMFS).

WATcloud SLURM is currently in beta. If you encounter any issues, Please review the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section
or [let us know](/docs/compute-cluster/support-resources).
</Callout>

## Terminology

Before we dive into the details, let's define some common terms used in SLURM:

- **Login node**: A node that users log into to submit jobs to the SLURM cluster. This is where you will interact with the SLURM cluster.
- **Compute node**: A node that runs jobs submitted to the SLURM cluster. This is where your job will run. Compute nodes are not directly accessible by users.
- **Partition**: A logical grouping of nodes in the SLURM cluster. Partitions can have different properties (e.g. different resource limits) and are used to organize resources.
- **Job**: A unit of work submitted to the SLURM cluster. A job can be interactive or batch.
- **Interactive job**: A job that runs interactively on a compute node. This is useful for debugging or running short tasks.
- **Batch job**: A job that runs non-interactively on a compute node. This is useful for running long-running tasks like simulations or ML training.
- **Job array**: A collection of jobs with similar parameters. This is useful for running parameter sweeps or other tasks that require running the same job multiple times with potentially different inputs.
- **Resource**: A physical or logical entity that can be allocated to a job. Examples include CPUs, memory, GPUs, and temporary disk space.
- **GRES (Generic Resource)**: A SLURM feature that allows for arbitrary resources to be allocated to jobs. Examples include GPUs and temporary disk space.

## Quick Start

To submit jobs to the SLURM cluster, you will need to log into one of the SLURM login nodes.
During the beta, they are labelled `SL` in the [machine list](/machines).
After the beta, all general-use machines will be SLURM login nodes.

### Interactive shell

Execute the following command to submit a job to the SLURM cluster:

```bash copy
srun --pty bash
```

This will start an interactive shell session on a compute node with the default resources.
You can view the resources allocated to your job by running:

```bash copy
scontrol show job $SLURM_JOB_ID
```

An example output is shown below:

```text {6,17}
JobId=1305 JobName=bash
   UserId=ben(1507) GroupId=ben(1507) MCS_label=N/A

   OverSubscribe=OK Contiguous=0 Licenses=(null) Network=(null)
   Command=bash
   WorkDir=/home/ben
   Power=
   TresPerNode=gres/tmpdisk:100
```

In this example, the job is allocated 1 CPU, 512MiB of memory, and 100MiB of temporary disk space (mounted at `/tmp`),
and is allowed to run for up to 30 minutes.

To request for more resources, you can use the `--cpus-per-task`, `--mem`, `--gres`, and `--time` flags.
For example, to request 4 CPUs, 4GiB of memory, 20GiB of temporary disk space, and 2 hours of running time, you can run:

```bash copy
srun --cpus-per-task 4 --mem 4G --gres tmpdisk:20480 --time 2:00:00 --pty bash
```

Note that the amount of requestable resources is limited by the resources available on the partition/node you are running on.
You can view the available resources by referring to the [View available resources](#view-available-resources) section.

### Cancelling a job

To cancel a job, you can use the `scancel` command.
You will need the job ID to cancel a job.
You can find the job ID by running `squeue`.
If you are in a job, you can also use the `$SLURM_JOB_ID` environment variable.

For example, you can see a list of your jobs by running:

```bash copy
squeue -u $(whoami)
```

Example output:

```text
JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
4022   compute     bash      ben  R       0:03      1 thor-slurm1
```

To cancel the job with ID `4022`, you can run:

```bash copy
scancel 4022
```

### Using Docker

Unlike general use machines, the SLURM environment does not provide user-space systemd for managing background processes like the Docker daemon.
To use Docker, you will need to start the Docker daemon manually. We have provided a convenience script to do this:

```bash copy
slurm-start-dockerd.sh
```

If successful, you should see the following output:

```text
Dockerd started successfully!

Test it with:
docker run --rm hello-world
```

Note that `slurm-start-dockerd.sh` places the Docker data directory in `/tmp`.
You can request for more space using the `--gres tmpdisk:<size_in_MiB>` flag.


### Using GPUs

You can request access to GPUs by using the `--gres shard:<size_in_MiB>` flag. For example, if your workload requires 4 GiB of VRAM, you can run:

```bash copy
srun --gres shard:4096 --pty bash
```

Your job will be allocated a GPU with at least 4 GiB of unreserved VRAM.
Please note that the amount of VRAM requested is not enforced, and you should ensure that the amount requested is appropriate for your workload.

Using `shard` is the preferred way to request for GPU resources because it allows multiple jobs to share the same GPU.

It's common to request extra tmpdisk space along with GPUs. To do this, you can append `,tmpdisk:<size_in_MiB>` to the `--gres` flag. For example:

```bash copy
srun --gres shard:4096,tmpdisk:20480 --pty bash
```

If your workload requires exclusive access to a GPU, you can use the `--gres gpu` flag instead:

<Callout type="warning">Because the cluster is GPU-constrained, requesting whole GPUs is not recommended unless your workload can
make efficient use of the entire GPU.</Callout>

```bash copy
srun --gres gpu:1 --pty bash
```

This will allocate a whole GPU to your job. Note that this will prevent other jobs from using the GPU until your job is finished.

### Using CUDA

If your workload requires CUDA, you have a few options (not exhaustive):

#### Using the `nvidia/cuda` Docker image

You can use the `nvidia/cuda` Docker image to run CUDA workloads.
Assuming you have started the Docker daemon (see [Using Docker](#using-docker)), you can run the following command to start a CUDA container:

```bash copy
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -v $(pwd):/workspace nvidia/cuda:12.0.0-devel-ubuntu22.04 nvcc --version
```

Note that the version of the Docker image must be compatible with (usually this means lower than or equal to) the driver version installed on the compute node.
You can check the driver version by running `nvidia-smi`. If the driver version is not compatible with the Docker image, you will get an error that looks like this:

```text
> docker run --rm -it --gpus all -v $(pwd):/workspace nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: error running hook #0: error running hook: exit status 1, stdout: , stderr: Auto-detected mode as 'legacy'
nvidia-container-cli: requirement error: unsatisfied condition: cuda>=12.1, please update your driver to a newer version, or use an earlier cuda container: unknown.
```

#### Using the Compute Canada CUDA module

The Compute Canada CVMFS[^cc-cvmfs] is mounted on the compute nodes. You can access CUDA by loading the appropriate module:

```bash
# Set up the module environment
source /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/config/profile/bash.sh
# Load the appropriate environment
module load StdEnv/2023
# Load the CUDA module
module load cuda/12.2
# Check the nvcc version
nvcc --version
```

Compute Canada only provides select versions of CUDA, and does not provide an easy way to list all available versions.
A trick you can use is to run `which nvcc{:bash}` and trace back along the directory tree to find sibling directories
that contain other CUDA versions.

Note that the version of CUDA must be compatible with the driver version installed on the compute node.
You can check the driver version by running `nvidia-smi`.
You can find the CUDA compatibility matrix [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).

[^cc-cvmfs]: The [Compute Canada CVMFS](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Accessing_CVMFS) is mounted at `/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca` on the compute nodes. It provides access to a wide variety of software via [Lmod modules](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Utiliser_des_modules/en).

### Batch jobs

The real power of SLURM comes from batch jobs.
Batch jobs are non-interactive jobs that start automatically when resources are available and release the resources when the job is finished.
This helps to maximize resource utilization and allows you to easily run large numbers of jobs (e.g. parameter sweeps).

To submit a batch job, create a script that looks like this:

```bash copy filename="slurm_job.sh"
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_job
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --mem=1G
#SBATCH --gres tmpdisk:1024
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --output=logs/%j-%x.out  # %j: job ID, %x: job name. Reference: https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#lbAH

echo "Hello, world! I'm running on $(hostname)"
echo "Counting to 60..."
for i in $(seq 60); do
    echo $i
    sleep 1
done
echo "Done!"
```

The `#SBATCH` lines are SLURM directives that specify the resources required by the job[^sbatch].
They are the same as the flags you would pass to `srun`.

To submit the job, run:

```bash copy
sbatch slurm_job.sh
```

This submits the job to the SLURM cluster, and you will receive a job ID in return.
After the job is submitted, it will be queued until resources are available.

You can see a list of your queued and in-progress jobs by running[^squeue]:

```bash copy
squeue -u $(whoami) --format="%.18i %.9P %.30j %.20u %.10T %.10M %.9l %.6D %R"
```

After the job starts, the output of the job is written to the file specified in the `--output` directive.
In the example above, you can view the output of the job by running:

```bash copy
tail -f logs/*-my_job.out
```

After the job finishes, it disappears from the queue.
You can retrieve useful information about the job (exit status, running time, etc.) by running[^sacct]:

```bash copy
sacct --format=JobID,JobName,State,ExitCode
```

[^sbatch]: `sbatch` is used to submit batch jobs to the SLURM cluster. For a full list of SLURM directives for `sbatch`, see the [sbatch documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html).
[^squeue]: `squeue` displays information about jobs in the queue. For a full list of formatting options, see the [squeue documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html#OPT_format).
[^sacct]: `sacct` displays accounting data for jobs and job steps. For more information, see the [sacct documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html).

#### Job arrays

Job arrays are a way to submit multiple jobs with similar parameters.
This is useful for running parameter sweeps or other tasks that require running the same job multiple times with potentially different inputs.

To submit a job array, create a script that looks like this:

```bash copy filename="slurm_job_array.sh" {7-8,10}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_job_array
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --mem=1G
#SBATCH --gres tmpdisk:1024
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --output=logs/%A-%a-%x.out # %A: job array master job allocation number, %a: Job array index, %x: job name. Reference: https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#lbAH
#SBATCH --array=1-10

echo "Hello, world! I'm job $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID, running on $(hostname)"
echo "Counting to 60..."
for i in $(seq 60); do
    echo $i
    sleep 1
done
echo "Done!"
```

The `--array` directive specifies the range of the job array (in this case, from 1 to 10, inclusive).

To submit the job array, run:

```bash copy
sbatch slurm_job_array.sh
```

This will submit 10 jobs with IDs ranging from 1 to 10.
You can view the status of the job array by running:

```bash copy
squeue -u $(whoami) --format="%.18i %.9P %.30j %.20u %.10T %.10M %.9l %.6D %R"
```

After jobs in the array start, the output of each job is written to a file specified in the `--output` directive.
In the example above, you can view the output of each job by running:

```bash copy
tail -f logs/*-my_job_array.out
```

To learn more about job arrays, including environment variables available to job array scripts,
see the [official documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_array.html).

#### Long-running jobs

Each job submitted to the SLURM cluster has a time limit.
The time limit can be set using the `--time` directive.
The maximum time limit is determined by the partition you are running on.
You can view a list of partitions, including the default partition, by running `sinfo`[^view-available-resources]:

```text
> sinfo
PARTITION     AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
compute*         up 1-00:00:00      5   idle thor-slurm1,tr-slurm1,trpro-slurm[1-2],wato2-slurm1
compute_dense    up 7-00:00:00      5   idle thor-slurm1,tr-slurm1,trpro-slurm[1-2],wato2-slurm1
```

In the output above, the cluster has 2 partitions, `compute` (default) and `compute_dense`, with time limits of 1 day and 7 days, respectively.
If your job requires more than the maximum time limit for the default partition, you can specify a different partition using the `--partition` flag.
For example:

```bash copy filename="slurm_compute_dense_partition.sh"
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_dense_job
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --mem=1G
#SBATCH --gres tmpdisk:1024
#SBATCH --partition=compute_dense
#SBATCH --time=2-00:00:00
#SBATCH --output=logs/%j-%x.out  # %j: job ID, %x: job name. Reference: https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#lbAH

echo "Hello, world! I'm allowed to run for 2 days!"
for i in $(seq $((60*60*24*2))); do
    echo $i
    sleep 1
done
echo "Done!"
```

## Extra details

### SLURM v.s. general-use machines

The SLURM environment is configured to be as close to the general-use environment as possible.
All of the same network drives and software are available. However, there are some differences:

- The SLURM environment uses a `/tmp` drive for temporary storage instead of `/mnt/scratch` on general-use machines.
    Temporary storage can be requested using the `--gres tmpdisk:<size_in_MiB>` flag.
- The SLURM environment does not have a user-space systemd for managing background processes like the Docker daemon.
    Please follow the instructions in the [Using Docker](#using-docker) section to start the Docker daemon.

### View available resources

There are a few ways to view the available resources on the SLURM cluster:

In this example, the node `trpro-slurm1` has the following allocable resources:
98 CPUs, around 413 GiB of RAM, 4 RTX 3090 GPUs, 98304 MiB of VRAM, and 300GiB of temporary disk space.

### GRES

GRES (Generic Resource)[^gres] is a SLURM feature that allows for arbitrary resources to be allocated to jobs.
The WATcloud cluster provides the following GRES:

[^gres]: https://slurm.schedmd.com/gres.html

#### `gres/tmpdisk`

`tmpdisk` is a GRES that represents temporary disk space. This resource is provisioned using a combination
of `job_container/tmpfs`[^job-container-tmpfs] and custom scripts. The temporary disk space is mounted at `/tmp` and is automatically
cleaned up when the job finishes. You can request for temporary disk space using the `--gres tmpdisk:<size_in_MiB>` flag.
Below is an example:

```bash
# Request 1 GiB of temporary disk space
srun --gres tmpdisk:1024 --pty bash
```

To see the total amount of temporary disk space available on a node, please refer to the [View available resources](#view-available-resources) section.

[^job-container-tmpfs]: https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_container_tmpfs.html

#### `gres/shard` and `gres/gpu`

`shard` and `gpu` are GRES that represent GPU resources.
Allocation of these resources is managed by built-in SLURM plugins that interface with various GPU libraries.

The `shard` GRES is used to request access to a portion of a GPU.
In the WATcloud cluster, the amount of allocable `shard` equals the amount of VRAM (in MiB) on each GPU.
This representation is chosen because it is a concrete metric that works across different GPU models.
The amount of resources requested using `shard` is not enforced, so please ensure that the `shard` requested is appropriate for your workload.
To request for `shard`, use the `--gres shard[:type]:<size_in_MiB>`[^shard-restriction] flag, where `type` is optional and can be used
to specify a specific GPU type. Below are some examples:

```bash
# Request 2 GiB of VRAM on any available GPU
srun --gres shard:2048 --pty bash

# Request 4 GiB of VRAM on an RTX 3090 GPU
srun --gres shard:rtx_3090:4096 --pty bash
```

To see a list of available GPU types, please refer to the [View available resources](#view-available-resources) section.

[^shard-restriction]: Note that `size_in_MiB` must not exceed the amount of VRAM on a single GPU
(can be determined by dividing the amount of `shard` available on a node by the number of GPUs on that node).
If you require more VRAM than a single GPU can provide, please use the `--gres gpu` flag instead (see below).

The `gpu` GRES is used to request exclusive access to GPUs[^gpu-management].
This is not recommended unless your workload can make efficient use of the entire GPU.
If you are unsure, please use the `shard` GRES instead.
To request for `gpu`, use the `--gres gpu[:type]:<number_of_gpus>` flag, where `type` is optional and can be used
to specify a specific GPU type. Below are some examples:

```bash
# Request access to any available GPU
srun --gres gpu:1 --pty bash

# Request access to a whole RTX 3090 GPU
srun --gres gpu:rtx_3090:1 --pty bash
```

To see a list of available GPU types, please refer to the [View available resources](#view-available-resources) section.

[^gpu-management]: For more information on GPU management, please refer to the [GPU Management](https://slurm.schedmd.com/gres.html#GPU_Management) SLURM documentation.

#### Requesting multiple GRES

You can request multiple GRES by separating them with a comma. For example, to request 1 GiB of `shard` and 2 GiB of `tmpdisk`, you can run:

```bash copy
srun --gres shard:1024,tmpdisk:2048 --pty bash
```

### CVMFS

CVMFS (CernVM File System)[^cvmfs] is a software distribution system that is widely adopted in the HPC community.
It provides a way to distribute software to compute nodes without having to install them on the nodes themselves.

We make use of the [Compute Canada CVMFS](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Accessing_CVMFS) to provide access to software available on Compute Canada clusters.
For example, you can access CUDA by loading the appropriate module (see [Using CUDA](#using-cuda)).
A list of all availalbe modules can be found via the [official documentation](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Available_software).

[^cvmfs]: https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Account

You may encounter the following error when trying to submit a job:

```text
srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified
```

This error usually occurs when your user does not have an associated account. You can verify this by running:

```bash copy
sacctmgr show user $(whoami)
```

If the output is empty (as shown below), then you do not have an associated account.

```text
      User   Def Acct     Admin
---------- ---------- ---------
```

A common reason for this is that your WATcloud profile is not associated with a registered affiliation[^registered-affiliation].
You can confirm this by requesting a copy of your profile using the [Profile Editor](/docs/utilities/profile-editor) and
checking whether the `general.affiliations` field contains a registered affiliation.
If your affiliation is not registered, please have your group lead fill out the [registration form](/docs/registered-affiliations#registering-a-group).

[^registered-affiliation]: Registered affiliations are distinct from "legacy" affiliations[^legacy-affiliation]. More information
    about registered affiliations can be found [here](/docs/registered-affiliations).
[^legacy-affiliation]: Legacy affiliations have the prefix `[Legacy]`. We don't have sufficient information from these affiliations
    to support them in the SLURM environment.
