# Getting Access to the Compute Cluster

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'
import { affiliationInfo } from '@/lib/data'
import { AffiliationList } from '@/components/affiliation-list'
 
<Steps>
### Determine your WATcloud contact

Every WATcloud compute cluster user has a WATcloud contact. Your WATcloud contact is a designated person within your group (usually your group lead)
who is responsible for approving your access request and assisting you during the onboarding process.

The following groups are registered with WATcloud:

<AffiliationList affiliationInfo={affiliationInfo} />

If your group is not listed or shows up as `[Legacy]`[^legacy-affiliation], please ask your group lead to [register the group][registered-affiliations] with WATcloud.

[registered-affiliations]: ../registered-affiliations
[^legacy-affiliation]: A legacy affiliation is a group that was onboarded before the current [registered affiliations][registered-affiliations] system was in place.
    Members of legacy affiliations can still access the compute cluster, but in order to use newer features like [SLURM](./slurm), the group must be registered.

### Fill out the onboarding form
 
Please fill out the [onboarding form](../utilities/onboarding-form) and make sure to enable the "Compute Cluster" option.
 
### Get approval from your WATcloud contact

Reach out to your WATcloud contact and ask them to approve your request.

### Wait for your access to be provisioned

After your request is approved, it usually takes about 15 minutes for your access to be provisioned. Your WATcloud contact has visibility
into the provisioning pipeline and can work with the WATcloud team to resolve any technical issues that may arise.

Once your access is provisioned, you will receive a welcome email.

In the mean time, please familiarize yourself with the [Machine Usage Guide](./machine-usage-guide).
