# WATcloud

WATcloud is a student-run cloud infrastructure group at the University of Waterloo.
Our main service is the [WATcloud compute cluster](/docs/compute-cluster) (sometimes referred to as "the compute cluster" or "WATcloud"),
where we provide compute (CPU and GPU), storage, and networking resources to student teams, clubs, and labs at the university and partnering organizations.

{/*
TODO: Once we have the affiliation infrastructure set up, list the number of student teams we help, the number of FYDP groups, and the total number of users.
We could list total users and the number of users in the past term and the current term.

## Brief History

WATcloud started as a group of computing enthusiasts who build servers at the [WATonomous][wato] student design team. Now we serve clubs
and teams from all over the University of Waterloo and support collaborative projects with international schools like [MIT][mit],
[Pitt][pitt], [RIT][rit], [CMU][cmu], and [PoliTO][polito][^international-collaboration].

[^international-collaboration]: An example of an international group we support is [MIT-PITT-RW][mprw] (MPRW), a collaboration between UWaterloo,
MIT, Pitt, and RIT to build a full-size self-driving racecar. UWaterloo students work alongside our international collaborators to use the
WATcloud compute cluster to develop software, run simulations, and train ML models.

## FAQ

### Is the compute cluster free to use?

Absolutely! We're a student-run group, and we don't charge for our infrastructure. However, we do have a limited amount of resources, so we ask that you use them responsibly.

### How do I get access to the compute cluster?

Please visit the [Getting Access](/docs/compute-cluster/getting-access) page for more information.

### Whatâ€™s the relationship between WATcloud and WATonomous?

WATonomous' compute cluster was born to meet the needs of the team. As the team grew, so did the cluster. Eventually, the subteam responsible for the cluster
became WATcloud, and opened up the cluster up to other groups. Now, WATcloud and WATonomous operate akin to AWS and Amazon.
We work in close proximity (e.g. we share the same Discord server and Google Workspace), but the services we provide are tailored to all groups we support.
WATonomous has access to the same [support resources](/docs/compute-cluster/support-resources) as every other group.
