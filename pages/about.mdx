**WATonomous is the autonomy design team at the University of Waterloo.** Our team centers around robotics software and designing systems capable of making autonomous decisions.

We are an agile group of developers, engineers, businessmen, designers, and marketers looking to lead the next generation of robotic and their applications to society. 

## Our Goal and Values

<Callout>
  **To show the world a bunch of students can build autonomous robots!** and in doing so, drive ourselves to become better people :)
</Callout>

At WATonomous, we value the following:

- **Humility:** Never act smarter than anyone else. Everyone starts somewhere, so never knock someone down for at least trying.
- **Inclusivity:** All that matters is that you want to become a robotics engineer, nothing else. We will provide you the resources to become one no matter your background.
- **Independence:** Our team is competition-independant. We function off of a diverse number of robotics projects driven by curiousity, ingenuity, and wow-factor.
- **Dreamy Pragmatism:** The future is bright. In our lifetime, robots will do our chores, drive our cars, and send us to mars. However, the people who are gonna get us there aren't the ones with their head in the clouds.
- **Grit:** You're gonna need it.
