# Onboarding

WATonomous onboarding guides. The following are quick jists of what each onboarding guide is for:

`ASD - Developing with WATcloud` Contains setup steps for getting access to WATcloud as well as how to use WATcloud in the Autonomous Software Division. ([go-to](/onboarding/asd_watcloud_dev))

`ASD - General Onboarding` Contains a walk-through that teaches you the basics of ROS2, Docker, Docker Compose, and the rest of our robotics software stack. ([go-to](/onboarding/asd_general_onboarding))
