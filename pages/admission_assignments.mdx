# WATonomous Admission Assignments

This is a directory of Assignments that are used to evaluate and train potential members of the team. Rule is, if you finish the assignment, then you are part of the team. Note: individuals can skip the assignment should they posses skills that WATonomous desperately needs.

**Note:** WATonomous hosts waves of group-admissions, where people interested in joining the team can work together to finish the assignment. This is called the **Expedited Admission**, and anyone who completes the assignment partially (cutoff determined on date expedited period ends) is allowed to join the team.
