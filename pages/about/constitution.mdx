### Section 1: Federated Team Structure

WATonomous operates using a **federated team model** that supports multiple autonomous robotics projects under one unified organization. This structure is designed to enable scalability, encourage ownership, and promote parallel development across different domains of autonomy.

**Key Characteristics**
- **Project-Based Divisions:** Each project (e.g., Eve, Rover, Humanoid, Micro-Autonomy) functions as a semi-autonomous unit.
- **Local Leadership:** Projects are led by their own set of **Co-Directors**, who oversee execution and direction within their scope.
- **Squad-Oriented Subteams:** Each project is further divided into **Squads**, led by **Squad Leads** and composed of **Core Members**.
- **Central Coordination:** The **Co-Captains** and **Admin Core** (e.g., BizOps, WATcloud) provide shared infrastructure, strategic alignment, and operational support.

This model balances **decentralized execution** with **centralized coordination**, allowing each project to innovate independently while remaining aligned with the team’s broader goals.

### Section 2: Adaptive Leadership

Leadership within WATonomous is intentionally designed to be **adaptive** to meet the evolving needs of each project.

**Leadership Roles**
- **Squad Leads** are assigned based on task ownership rather than fixed roles.
- Squad responsibilities are **fluid (even between software and hardware)**, enabling members to take charge of specific initiatives or deliverables as needed.
- **Co-Directors** of each project are responsible for defining how leadership is distributed within their teams.

**Guiding Principles**
- **Task-Based Authority:** Leadership is delegated according to expertise, initiative, and the nature of the work.
- **Collaborative Structure:** Squad Leads collaborate closely with Co-Directors to ensure technical and logistical alignment.
- **Leadership Development:** The system encourages all members to grow into leadership roles based on merit and engagement.

This approach fosters an agile, bottom-up culture that empowers members to lead, take initiative, and directly shape their project’s success.


## Article IV – Role Descriptions

**Faculty Advisors and Alumni Board**
- Serve in an advisory capacity to provide long-term guidance, mentorship, and institutional memory.

- Do not participate in day-to-day operations but may review major strategic initiatives.

- Serve as a direct connection to the University of Waterloo and Industry

**Co-Captains**
- Represent the overall WATonomous team and are responsible for strategic vision, inter-project coordination, and organizational cohesion.

- Facilitate communication across directors, oversee high-level planning, and ensure alignment with long-term goals.

- Appoint or confirm project and administrative leadership roles when necessary.

**Directors and Co-Directors**
- Lead either an administrative vertical (e.g., BizOps, WATcloud) or a technical project (e.g., Rover, Eve).

- Define goals, timelines, and processes for their domain.

- Are accountable to the Co-Captains for progress and member well-being within their teams.

- Co-Directors of a project operate with equal authority to enable collaborative leadership and load sharing.

**Squad Leads**
- Coordinate and guide a focused group (or “squad”) within a project or administrative team.

- Lead execution of key tasks or deliverables and facilitate collaboration among Core Members.

- Are appointed by the Co-Directors of their project based on need, expertise, or initiative.

- May change over time depending on project needs (adaptive leadership).

**Core Members**
- Actively contribute to a project or administrative initiative on a regular basis.

- Take ownership of technical tasks, documentation, testing, event planning, or other responsibilities as needed.

- Are encouraged to pursue Squad Lead roles based on interest and engagement.

## Article V – Leadership Selection

### Section 1: Term Limits

Term limits are imposed to facilitate a healthy transition of power and strengthen our team's ability to transfer knowledge across generations. Each lead position has its own term limit:

- **Co-Captains and Project Directors:** 2 years  
- **Squad Leads:** No term limit. However, continuation in the role is at the discretion of the respective Project Director.

### Section 2: Transitioning Leadership

Leads may resign from their position for two reasons:
1. Their term limit has been reached.  
2. They no longer wish to continue in a leadership role.

When a lead resigns, a new lead must be appointed. The process depends on the role of the resigning lead:

#### **Co-Captain**

New Co-Captains are elected by a vote from the current Directors of WATonomous. A candidate must receive at least 80% of the vote to be selected. If no candidate meets this threshold, a revote is held. Candidates are encouraged to resolve differences and consolidate interests between revotes.

**Minimum Requirements to be a Candidate:**
- Must have held a lead position in WATonomous for at least one term.
- Must not have previously served as a Co-Captain.

**Transition Process:**
1. A Co-Captain announces their resignation, either due to term completion or personal choice.
2. A team-wide announcement is made, and the search for candidates begins.
3. The first vote is held one week after the resignation announcement.
4. If the first vote fails, revotes may occur, no sooner than 30 minutes after the previous vote.
5. Once a new Co-Captain is selected, a 1-month transition period begins, during which responsibilities and knowledge are transferred.

> *Note:* The resigning Co-Captain remains responsible for day-to-day tasks until the transition is complete.

#### **Director**

New Directors are identified and selected by current Co-Captains and Directors.

**Minimum Requirements to be Considered:**
- (Optional) Previously served as a Lead.
- (Optional) Expressed interest in leadership to current Directors or Co-Captains (via DMs or public messages).
- Demonstrated leadership ability.

**Transition Process:**
1. A Director announces their resignation, either due to term completion or personal choice.
2. A project-wide announcement is made, and the search for a replacement begins.
3. The resigning Director is responsible for identifying a suitable replacement.
4. The candidate must receive 80% approval from all other Directors and Co-Captains.
5. If the first vote fails, other Directors or Co-Captains may propose additional candidates. Revotes may occur no sooner than 30 minutes after the previous vote.
6. Once a new Director is selected, a 2-week transition period begins, during which responsibilities and knowledge are transferred.

> *Note:* The resigning Director remains responsible for day-to-day tasks until the transition is complete.

#### **Squad Lead**

New Squad Leads are selected by the Project/Division Directors and are appointed based on the tasks at hand.

**Minimum Requirements to be Considered:**
- (Optional) Expressed interest in leadership to Directors or Co-Captains (via DMs or public messages).
- Demonstrated leadership ability.

**Transition Process:**
1. New tasks emerge that require the formation of a squad (e.g., perception, electrical, etc.). The Director defines the squad's scope.
2. The Project Director appoints a Squad Lead.
3. The Squad Lead remains in position until the Director reassigns the role or the squad is dissolved.
4. If the Squad Lead resigns while the squad is still active, they are responsible for recommending a replacement.
5. If the recommended replacement is not approved by the Directors, the Directors will select an alternative candidate.
6. Once a replacement is selected, a 1-week transition period begins for knowledge transfer.

> *Note:* Squad Leads and squads are fluid and form based on the tasks at hand. Resigning Squad Leads are expected to retain responsibilities until a replacement is confirmed.

## Article VI - Emergency Clause

In times of emergency, term limits may be suspended, and leadership transitions will be handled by the current leadership team, Faculty Advisors, and active Alumni Board Members.

**What Constitutes an Emergency?**
- WATonomous membership drops below 20 people.
- A serious accident causes hospitalization of members.
- Natural disasters or major political events affecting the region (e.g., war, martial law, rebellion, or murder).

**Emergency Leadership Meeting:**
In the event of an emergency, a dedicated meeting will be held and announced team-wide at least one week in advance.

During this meeting, two key topics must be addressed:
- **Team Strategy:** How will we overcome this crisis? What are the concrete milestones, and who is responsible for them?
- **Leadership:** Who will guide us through this period?

> *Note:* Full consensus must be reached among attendees. If consensus is not achieved, WATonomous risks failure—not because the organization is flawed, but because its members no longer have the collective will to sustain it.

## Article VII – Membership

### Section 1: Eligibility

Membership is open to:
- Students and faculty of the University of Waterloo  
- Alumni of the University of Waterloo  

> *Note:* Special arrangements may be made for individuals outside the University of Waterloo if approved by an 80% majority vote from the WATonomous leadership.
